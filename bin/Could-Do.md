- FIXME rectify printing free blocks
- TODO buddy method
- TODO linked list for freeblocks
- TODO piazza memory manager
- TODO how to write tests when the output is being sent to a file
- print the free blocks in the position they end (so if entire 32 is free then we print 32:32)
- unit test to check the value of 
- use the class variables this.checkInsertion true while testing functions which dont return anything
- implement hash table to make sure that Handle is not initialized in it
- rehash free blocks once 

## TESTS
- insert false
- delete false condition
- get capacity of the hashTable
- find function testing the break condition (searching for an element that doesnt exist)

- empty table search 
- empty table delete
- delete true
- delete false
- search found
- search not found
- hash collision (insertion when element already exists at given position for ex: inserting 1 and 9)
- print hashing
- search for tombstone in hash (read console output)
- wrap around hash (?)
- delete all elements in the hash (all should be tombstones)
- tombstone insert (?)
- hash insert into tombstone
- expand table with tombstone (hash table of size 4, and delete 2 elements, then insert another and check if deleted)
